# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical ESLint errors preventing the MP4 to GIF Next.js project from building and deploying to Cloudflare. The project currently fails during the build process due to `react/no-unescaped-entities` and `@next/next/no-img-element` ESLint rule violations across multiple page components.

The goal is to systematically fix all ESLint errors while maintaining code quality, functionality, and ensuring successful deployment to Cloudflare using OpenNext and Wrangler.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all ESLint errors to be resolved so that the project can build successfully and deploy to Cloudflare.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build command `npm run build` is executed THEN the system SHALL complete without ESLint errors
2. WHEN the deployment command `npm run deploy` is executed THEN the system SHALL successfully deploy to Cloudflare
3. WHEN ESLint is run via `npm run lint` THEN the system SHALL report zero errors
4. WHEN the project is built THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unescaped entities in JSX to be properly escaped so that React components render correctly and comply with ESLint rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSX contains single quotes (') THEN the system SHALL use proper HTML entities (&apos;, &lsquo;, &#39;, or &rsquo;)
2. WHEN JSX contains double quotes (") THEN the system SHALL use proper HTML entities (&quot;, &ldquo;, &#34;, or &rdquo;)
3. WHEN JSX contains apostrophes in contractions THEN the system SHALL use appropriate HTML entities
4. WHEN the page renders THEN all text SHALL display correctly with proper quotation marks
5. WHEN ESLint scans JSX files THEN the system SHALL not report react/no-unescaped-entities violations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want image elements to use Next.js optimized Image components so that the application follows Next.js best practices and improves performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying images THEN the system SHALL use Next.js Image component instead of HTML img tags
2. WHEN images are loaded THEN the system SHALL benefit from Next.js automatic optimization
3. WHEN ESLint scans components THEN the system SHALL not report @next/next/no-img-element warnings
4. WHEN images are displayed THEN all existing styling and functionality SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN images fail to load THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ESLint configuration to be appropriate for the project so that it catches real issues without blocking legitimate code patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint rules are configured THEN the system SHALL maintain code quality standards
2. WHEN legitimate code patterns are used THEN ESLint SHALL not produce false positive errors
3. WHEN the project uses Cloudflare-specific patterns THEN ESLint SHALL accommodate these requirements
4. WHEN new code is written THEN ESLint SHALL provide helpful guidance without being overly restrictive

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all fixes to be systematically applied across the codebase so that no files are missed and consistency is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL process all affected files (app/about/page.tsx, app/cookies/page.tsx, app/page.tsx, app/privacy/page.tsx, app/terms/page.tsx, components/GifConverter.tsx)
2. WHEN text content is modified THEN the system SHALL preserve the original meaning and readability
3. WHEN components are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing props and functionality
4. WHEN fixes are complete THEN the system SHALL pass all existing tests (if any)
5. WHEN the application runs THEN all pages SHALL render correctly with no visual regressions
